# ML Detection & Forecasting App

This Streamlit application provides an interactive interface for performing **classification (detection)** and **time series forecasting** using various machine learning models. Users can upload datasets, choose models, visualize results, and make predictions.

[Run](https://classification-and-forecasting-egrpoafdknpwx5ga5nmm2y.streamlit.app/)!

## Features

### üîç Classification (Detection)
- Choose from multiple datasets: **Iris, Wine, Digits**
- Select different ML models:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - AdaBoost
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Displays:
  - Accuracy, classification report
  - Confusion matrix heatmap
  - ROC Curve (for probabilistic models)
- Custom input prediction

### üìà Time Series Forecasting
- Uses a synthetic time-series dataset
- Supports:
  - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - **Exponential Smoothing**
- Displays:
  - Time-series visualization
  - Forecasted values for future dates
